# EP-related secrets

Everything in this folder (except this document) is supposed to be git ignored and should not be committed to the repository.

Example:

```nix
{
  github = {
    fullName = "FirstName LastName";
    userName = "<Your GitHub username>";
    userEmail = "<your.email@bigbank.com>";
    token = "<Your GitHub token>";
  };
}
```
